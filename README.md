# ESP8266-somfy-situo-5

Using an ESP8266 with LUA and RestAPI with an Somfy Situo 5 io Pure II Remote.
In the final Version i want to use NodeRed to access the ESP8266 to operate my curtain and shutter.

1. Get an second Situo 5 io Pure II Remote and connect it to your Somfy motors.
2. Get an ESP8266 and flash an Firmware with the following modules: adc, crypto, encoder, file, gpio, http, net, node, sjson, sntp, struct, tmr, uart, websocket, wifi, wifi_monitor
3. I use ESPlorer to save the code on the ESP8266.
4. Open the Remote and solder the wire, connect them to the ESP8266.
